# UnityMegamanX

Megaman X is a game first released for the SNES console.
Here is the reference for the wiki: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mega_Man_X_(video_game)

The game is currently being developed in 2D. It is not HD yet but ideally the game is going to be HD.

The first step is to get a production quality replica of the game using the Unity Engine.
The second step is to add our own bosses and features.

The goal is to have fun and get a good portfolio piece when this project gets finished.

Rewards for working on this project:
Fun
Experience
Portfolio
Maybe working on our own platformer once we are done with this one.
